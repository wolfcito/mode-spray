# Responsible Disclosure Policy

At ModeSpray, we take security seriously and are committed to protecting our users. We appreciate responsible security researchers who help us identify and fix vulnerabilities in a responsible manner.

## üì¢ Reporting Security Issues  
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in ModeSpray, we encourage you to report it as soon as possible.

- **How to report**: Please create a **GitHub Issue** in our repository: [**GitHub repo link**]([https://github.com/wolfcito/mode-spray/issues/new?template=Blank+issue](https://github.com/wolfcito/mode-spray)).
- **What to include in your report**:  
  - A clear explanation of the vulnerability.  
  - Steps to reproduce the issue.  
  - Any potential security impact.  
  - Any suggested fixes, if applicable.  

üö® **Only issues that allow unauthorized token extraction or transaction execution without user consent are considered critical.** ModeSpray is a **community-driven project**, and all users are responsible for their own security.

## üö® What We Expect from Researchers  
- Act in **good faith** and **responsibly**.  
- **Do not** exploit, leak, or use the vulnerability for malicious purposes.  
- **Do not** conduct attacks that could harm users, including DoS, social engineering, or phishing.  
- **Do not** demand payment, blackmail, or threaten legal action.  

## üîí What You Can Expect from Us  
- We will acknowledge the report within **48 hours**.  
- We will investigate the issue and, if valid, work on a fix.  
- We will credit the researcher (if they wish) after the fix is deployed.  

## ‚ùå No Bug Bounty Program  
At this time, **ModeSpray does not have a bug bounty program**. While we appreciate responsible reports, we do not offer financial rewards.  

## ‚ö† Legal Considerations  
- Unauthorized access, modification, or disruption of services may be **illegal**.  
- We do not tolerate **extortion, threats, or blackmail** related to security reports.  
- Any unethical behavior will be reported to the appropriate authorities.
